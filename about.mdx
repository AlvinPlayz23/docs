# About PROJECT-X

Welcome to PROJECT-X, the official open source version of Bolt.new, which allows you to choose the LLM that you use for each prompt! Currently, you can use OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, OpenRouter, Gemini, LMStudio, Mistral, xAI, HuggingFace, DeepSeek, or Groq models - and it is easily extended to use any other model supported by the Vercel AI SDK!

## Project Management

PROJECT-X is a community effort! The core team of contributors aims at organizing the project in a way that allows you to understand where the current areas of focus are.

If you want to know what we are working on, what we are planning to work on, or if you want to contribute to the project, please check the project management guide to get started easily.
