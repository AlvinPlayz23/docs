# AI Prompt Documentation

PROJECT-X leverages advanced AI models to generate websites from natural language prompts. This guide helps you craft effective prompts for optimal results.

## Prompt Structure

Effective prompts should include:

1. **Website Purpose** - Clearly state what the website is for
2. **Target Audience** - Describe who will use the website
3. **Design Preferences** - Mention any style or layout preferences
4. **Content Requirements** - Specify must-have pages or sections

## Prompt Examples

### Basic Business Website
"Create a professional website for a dental clinic in Miami. The website should have:
- Homepage with hero section
- About Us page with dentist bios
- Services page listing dental procedures
- Contact page with map and appointment form
Use a clean, modern design with blue and white colors."

### E-commerce Site
"Generate an online store for handmade jewelry with:
- Product showcase grid
- Shopping cart functionality
- About the artisan section
- Contact page with inquiry form
Use an elegant, minimalist design with gold accents."

## Advanced Techniques

- **Iterative Refinement** - Start with broad concepts, then refine specific elements
- **Style References** - Include URLs to sites you like as style examples
- **Technical Requirements** - Specify any integrations needed (payment, booking, etc.)
