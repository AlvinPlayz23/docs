# OpenAI Integration

PROJECT-X supports OpenAI's powerful language models, allowing you to leverage models like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 for your development needs.

## Setting Up OpenAI

To use OpenAI models with PROJECT-X, you'll need to:

1. Create an OpenAI account at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Generate an API key in your OpenAI dashboard
3. Enter your API key in the PROJECT-X settings

<Note>
  Your API key is stored locally and is never sent to our servers. PROJECT-X communicates directly with OpenAI's API.
</Note>

## Available Models

PROJECT-X supports the following OpenAI models:

- **GPT-4** - Most powerful model for complex tasks
- **GPT-4 Turbo** - Optimized version of GPT-4 with improved performance
- **GPT-3.5 Turbo** - Fast and cost-effective for most development tasks

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how you might prompt OpenAI models in PROJECT-X:

```
Create a React component that displays a list of items with pagination. 
The component should:
- Accept an array of items as a prop
- Display 10 items per page
- Include previous/next buttons
- Show the current page number
```

This specific prompt gives the model clear requirements, making it more likely to generate useful code.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with OpenAI integration:

1. **API Key Issues** - Verify your API key is correct and has sufficient credits
2. **Rate Limiting** - OpenAI has rate limits that may affect usage during heavy traffic
3. **Model Availability** - Some models may have limited availability during high demand
4. **Token Limits** - Large projects may exceed token limits for context window
