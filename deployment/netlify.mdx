# Deploying to Netlify

PROJECT-X allows you to deploy your applications directly to Netlify with just a few clicks. This feature makes it easy to share your projects with others or launch them for production use.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying to Netlify, ensure you have:

1. A completed PROJECT-X application that's ready for deployment
2. A Netlify account (you can sign up for free at [netlify.com](https://netlify.com))
3. Properly configured build settings in your project

## Deployment Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Your Project">
    Make sure your project is working correctly in the PROJECT-X preview. Test all functionality before deployment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Build Settings">
    Ensure your project has the necessary build configuration. For most web applications, this includes:
    
    ```json
    // package.json example
    {
      "scripts": {
        "build": "vite build",
        "dev": "vite"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiate Deployment">
    In the PROJECT-X interface, look for the "Deploy" button and select "Deploy to Netlify" from the options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate with Netlify">
    You'll be prompted to log in to your Netlify account or authorize PROJECT-X to deploy on your behalf.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Deployment Settings">
    Review and adjust the deployment settings if needed. PROJECT-X will automatically detect the correct build command and publish directory for most projects.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Click the final deploy button to start the deployment process. PROJECT-X will package your application and send it to Netlify.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After Deployment

Once your application is deployed:

1. **Access Your Site** - Netlify will provide a unique URL where your site is hosted
2. **Custom Domain** - You can configure a custom domain in your Netlify dashboard
3. **Continuous Deployment** - Set up continuous deployment from GitHub if you've published your project there

<Note>
  Netlify offers many advanced features like form handling, serverless functions, and more. Visit the [Netlify documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/) to learn about these capabilities.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during deployment:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Build Failures">
    Check your build command and dependencies. Make sure all required packages are installed and your build script is correct.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing Assets">
    Ensure your assets are properly referenced and included in your build output directory.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Environment Variables">
    If your application requires environment variables, make sure to configure them in your Netlify site settings.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example: Deploying a React Application

Here's a typical workflow for deploying a React application created with PROJECT-X to Netlify:

1. Create your React application using PROJECT-X
2. Test the application thoroughly in the preview
3. Click the "Deploy" button and select "Deploy to Netlify"
4. Authenticate with your Netlify account
5. PROJECT-X will automatically set the build command to `npm run build` and the publish directory to `dist`
6. Click "Deploy" to finalize the process
7. Once complete, you'll receive a URL where your application is hosted
