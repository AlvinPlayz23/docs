# Publishing to GitHub

PROJECT-X allows you to publish your projects directly to GitHub, making it easy to share your code, collaborate with others, or set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

## Prerequisites

Before publishing to GitHub, ensure you have:

1. A completed PROJECT-X application that's ready for sharing
2. A GitHub account (you can sign up for free at [github.com](https://github.com))
3. Properly structured project with appropriate documentation

## Publication Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Your Project">
    Make sure your project is working correctly in the PROJECT-X preview. Add a README.md file with project information if you haven't already.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiate GitHub Publication">
    In the PROJECT-X interface, look for the "Publish" or "Export" button and select "Publish to GitHub" from the options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate with GitHub">
    You'll be prompted to log in to your GitHub account or authorize PROJECT-X to create repositories on your behalf.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Repository Settings">
    Enter repository details such as:
    - Repository name
    - Description
    - Visibility (public or private)
    - License type
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Files">
    Review the files that will be published to GitHub. You can exclude certain files if needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish">
    Click the final publish button to create your GitHub repository and push your code.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After Publication

Once your project is published to GitHub:

1. **Access Your Repository** - You'll receive a link to your new GitHub repository
2. **Clone Locally** - You can clone the repository to continue development locally
3. **Set Up CI/CD** - Configure GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools for automated testing and deployment
4. **Collaborate** - Invite collaborators to work on your project

<Note>
  Consider adding GitHub-specific files like CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, and ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md to make your project more community-friendly.
</Note>

## Best Practices

When publishing PROJECT-X applications to GitHub:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Comprehensive README" icon="book">
    Create a detailed README.md with installation instructions, usage examples, and project information
  </Card>
  <Card title=".gitignore" icon="eye-slash">
    Include a proper .gitignore file to exclude node_modules, build artifacts, and environment files
  </Card>
  <Card title="License" icon="scale-balanced">
    Choose an appropriate license for your project to clarify how others can use your code
  </Card>
  <Card title="Documentation" icon="file-lines">
    Include additional documentation beyond the README for complex projects
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Example Workflow

Here's a typical workflow for publishing a PROJECT-X application to GitHub:

1. Create your application using PROJECT-X
2. Test the application thoroughly in the preview
3. Add a comprehensive README.md file
4. Click the "Publish" button and select "Publish to GitHub"
5. Authenticate with your GitHub account
6. Configure your repository settings (name, description, visibility)
7. Review the files to be published
8. Click "Publish" to create your GitHub repository
9. Once complete, you'll receive a link to your new repository
